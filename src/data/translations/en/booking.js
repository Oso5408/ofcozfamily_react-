    terms: `üëÄ Customer and User Guidelines:

**To ensure a comfortable environment in the shared space and to avoid disrupting classes, please maintain quiet. Non-venue users (parents, companions) are requested not to linger on the premises and to avoid arriving 'too early' to pick up children;

*If circumstances permit, 15 minutes of pre-class preparation time will be provided. Please notify staff before entering the room; do not enter without permission;

*To avoid affecting other customers, you must return the room "on time". Please keep it clean and collect your personal belongings after class. No eating is allowed in the rooms. Thank you for your cooperation. (Overtime will be charged by the hour);

*For package customers, token waiver benefits for cancellations are as follows:
- Cancellations made more than 48 hours in advance: Up to 3 waivers per month.
- Cancellations made less than 48 hours in advance: 1 waiver per month.
(This means a maximum of 3 booking cancellations per month. Cancellations made less than 48 hours in advance are included. If you exceed 3 cancellations, tokens for the current cancellation will be deducted. Customers should cancel through the system. Tokens will not be refunded for no-shows.)

*Paid package fees and expired tokens are non-refundable;
Expired balances are non-transferable. Renewing a package within 180 days of expiry allows the remaining balance to be carried over;

*Hourly Rental Cancellation and Rebooking Policy
- Once an hourly booking is confirmed and paid, cancellations are non-refundable.
- Please complete rebooking within 90 days from the cancellation date.

Special Circumstances
- If a booking is cancelled less than 48 hours in advance or if you do not show up at the booked time, no refund will be given.
- Rebooking is also not available in such cases.

*Please make good use of the room resources;

*Please collect necessary items from the storage room yourself and return them to their original place after use;

*The center reserves the right to make special arrangements and temporarily reassign rooms according to the situation on the day, without prior notice. We appreciate your understanding;

*Some courses need to be conducted in dim lighting. Please do not open the doors of other rooms without permission. Thank you for your cooperation;

*In support of environmental protection, please bring your own lidded water bottle;

*If you need to use a massage/beauty bed, please bring your own disposable bed sheet;

*There are pets (cats) üê± on the premises. If you are allergic to pets, please assess your suitability before entering. The company is not responsible for any related issues. Thank you for your understanding.

You are welcome to schedule a visit üòä`
