# Room Booking System with Cash Payment - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Phase 1-3 Complete ✅ | Phase 4-6 Pending ⏳

---

## 📋 Overview

Implemented a comprehensive room booking system focused on **cash payment** management with admin confirmation flow. The system allows customers to book rooms with cash payment, and admins can manually confirm payments when received.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### Phase 1: Database Setup

**Files Created:**
1. `supabase/seed-rooms.sql` - Seed script for Rooms A-H
2. `supabase/booking-payment-fields.sql` - Admin payment tracking fields
3. `supabase/ROOM_BOOKING_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide

**Database Changes:**
- ✅ Added `admin_notes` column to bookings table
- ✅ Added `payment_confirmed_at` timestamp column
- ✅ Added `payment_confirmed_by` foreign key to users table
- ✅ Added `pending_payment` status to booking statuses
- ✅ Created seed data for 8 rooms (A-H)
- ✅ Room G set as hidden (requires manual admin control)

**Rooms Seeded:**
| Room | ID | Visible | Price (Hourly) | Payment Options |
|------|----|----|--------|-----------------|
| Room A | 8 | ❌ Hidden | $120 | Token, Cash |
| Room B | 1 | ✅ Visible | $120 | Token, Cash |
| Room C | 2 | ✅ Visible | $150 | Cash only |

### Phase 2: Booking Flow Migration

**Files Modified:**
1. `/src/pages/BookingPage.jsx` - Migrated from localStorage to Supabase
2. `/src/services/bookingService.js` - Added payment management methods
3. `/src/services/roomService.js` - Added room visibility toggle

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Booking creation now uses Supabase (`bookingService.createBooking()`)
- ✅ Room availability check uses Supabase function (`check_room_availability`)
- ✅ Cash bookings create with `payment_status: 'pending'` and `status: 'pending_payment'`
- ✅ Token bookings immediately confirmed with `payment_status: 'paid'`
- ✅ Calculates cost based on booking type (hourly/daily/monthly)
- ✅ Customer sees clear message: "Please pay at venue, admin will confirm"

**Cash Booking Flow:**
```
Customer selects room → Books with cash →
  Booking created (pending_payment) →
    Customer pays at venue →
      Admin marks as paid →
        Booking confirmed ✅
```

**New Service Methods:**
- `bookingService.markAsPaid(bookingId, adminUserId, adminNotes)`
- `bookingService.getPendingPayments()`
- `bookingService.getBookingsByDateRange(startDate, endDate, options)`
- `roomService.toggleRoomVisibility(roomId, hidden)`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.bookings
ADD COLUMN admin_notes TEXT,
ADD COLUMN payment_confirmed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN payment_confirmed_by UUID REFERENCES public.users(id);

-- New status constraint
ADD CONSTRAINT bookings_status_check
CHECK (status IN ('pending_payment', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'completed', 'no-show'));
```

### API Methods

**bookingService:**
```javascript
// Create booking
createBooking(bookingData)

// Mark as paid (admin only)
markAsPaid(bookingId, adminUserId, adminNotes)

// Get pending payments (admin only)
getPendingPayments()

```

**roomService:**
```javascript
// Toggle room visibility (admin only)
toggleRoomVisibility(roomId, hidden)

// Get rooms (with/without hidden)
getRooms(includeHidden = false)
```

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Customer Books a Room (Cash):

```javascript
// In BookingPage.jsx
const result = await bookingService.createBooking({
  userId: user.id,
  roomId: 3, // Room D
  startTime: '2025-10-10T10:00:00Z',
  endTime: '2025-10-10T12:00:00Z',
  bookingType: 'hourly',
  paymentMethod: 'cash',
  paymentStatus: 'pending',      // Awaiting payment
  totalCost: 240,                // $120/hour × 2 hours
  status: 'pending_payment',      // Awaiting admin confirmation
  notes: JSON.stringify({...})
});

// Customer sees: "Your booking has been submitted. Please pay at the venue."
```

### Admin Marks Booking as Paid:

```javascript
// In AdminBookingsTab.jsx
const result = await bookingService.markAsPaid(
  'booking-uuid',
  currentUser.id,  // Admin user ID
  'Received $240 cash from John Doe'
);

// Booking updates:
// - status: 'pending_payment' → 'confirmed'
// - payment_status: 'pending' → 'paid'
// - payment_confirmed_at: '2025-10-10T09:45:00Z'
// - payment_confirmed_by: admin_user_id
// - admin_notes: 'Received $240 cash from John Doe'
```

### Admin Toggles Room G Visibility:

```javascript
// In RoomManagementTab.jsx (to be created)
const result = await roomService.toggleRoomVisibility(
  6,     // Room G
  false  // Make visible
);

// Room G now appears on public rooms page
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Notes

### Current Limitations:

1. **AdminBookingsTab partially migrated**
   - Still uses localStorage for some operations
   - Payment confirmation uses Supabase
   - Full migration needed in Phase 6

2. **Room G visibility**
   - Admin UI not yet created (Phase 5)
   - Can be manually toggled via SQL:
     ```sql
     UPDATE rooms SET hidden = FALSE WHERE id = 6;
     ```

3. **Email notifications**
   - Optional feature, not yet implemented
   - Placeholder commented out in `handleConfirmPayment()`

### Important Notes:

- ⚠️ Run database SQL scripts before using: `seed-rooms.sql` and `booking-payment-fields.sql`
- ⚠️ Room data temporarily fetched from `roomsData.js`, should migrate to Supabase in Phase 2
- ⚠️ Admin must be logged in with `is_admin: true` to access payment confirmation

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Database Setup:
- [x] Run `supabase/seed-rooms.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [x] Run `supabase/booking-payment-fields.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
