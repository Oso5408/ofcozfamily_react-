## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
- Solution: Ensure `.env` file exists and restart dev server

**User created in auth but not in users table**
- Solution: Re-run `/supabase/complete-setup.sql` to create trigger

**"This email is already registered" but user doesn't exist**
- Solution: Check in Supabase → Authentication → Users (may be soft-deleted)

**Registration succeeds but no redirect**
- Solution: Check browser console for errors. Verify routing is working.

**Password validation too strict**
- Solution: Modify `/src/utils/validation.js` → `validatePassword()` function
