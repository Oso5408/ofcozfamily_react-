# Verify Login Credentials

## ✅ Good News: Supabase is Working!

The error "Invalid login credentials" means your Supabase configuration is **working correctly**. This is the normal error when someone enters wrong credentials.

## Check Your Login

### Option 1: Create a New Test Account

1. **Go to your production website**
2. **Click "Register" / "Sign Up"**
3. **Create a test account:**
   - Email: `test@example.com` (or your real email)
   - Password: Create a secure password
   - Fill in required fields
4. **Check your email** (if email confirmation is enabled)
5. **Try logging in** with those credentials

### Option 2: Check Existing Users in Supabase

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rlfrwsyqletwegvflqip

2. **Click "Authentication" (left sidebar)**

3. **Click "Users" tab**

4. **You'll see all registered users:**
   - Email addresses
   - Confirmation status
   - Last sign in

5. **Try logging in with one of those emails** (if you know the password)

### Option 3: Reset Password

If you have an account but forgot the password:

1. **Click "Forgot Password" on login page**
2. **Enter your email**
3. **Check your email for reset link**
4. **Set new password**
5. **Try logging in**

## Verify Email Confirmation Settings

If users can't login after registering:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rlfrwsyqletwegvflqip

3. **Check "Email" provider settings:**
   - **If "Confirm email" is ON:**
     - Users must click link in email before logging in
     - Check spam folder for confirmation email

   - **If "Confirm email" is OFF:**
     - Users can login immediately after registration
     - No email confirmation needed

4. **You can toggle this setting:**
   - Turn OFF for easier testing
   - Turn ON for production security
